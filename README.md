# BuildItBigger

## the fourth project of Android Developer Nanodegree course by UDACITY.

### Project Overview

In this project, you will create an app with multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and Google Cloud Endpoints. The finished app will consist of four modules:

    A Java library that provides jokes
    A Google Cloud Endpoints (GCE) project that serves those jokes
    An Android Library containing an activity for displaying jokes
    An Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display

### Why this Project?

As Android projects grow in complexity, it becomes necessary to customize the behavior of the Gradle build tool, allowing automation of repetitive tasks. Particularly, factoring functionality into libraries and creating product flavors allow for much bigger projects with minimal added complexity.

### What Will I Learn?

You will learn the role of Gradle in building Android Apps and how to use Gradle to manage apps of increasing complexity. You'll learn to:

    Add free and paid flavors to an app, and set up your build to share code between them
    Factor reusable functionality into a Java library
    Factor reusable Android functionality into an Android library
    Configure a multi project build to compile your libraries and app
    Use the Gradle App Engine plugin to deploy a backend
    Configure an integration test suite that runs against the local App Engine development server
